Tools for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh).

# Current Versions

The `master` branch of this (and other) repositories track ongoing developments, and may be newer than what is used for the live osu! systems. If looking to use the correct version for matching live values, the correct versions are:

| `osu-tools` | `osu` |
| -- | -- |
| [2022.1017.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/releases/tag/2022.1017.0) | [2022.927.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/2022.927.0) ([nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ppy.osu.Game/2022.927.0)) |

# Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting, such as the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- These instructions assume you have the the [CLI git client](https://git-scm.com/) installed, but any other GUI client such as GitKraken will suffice.
- Note that there are **[additional requirements for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60#dependencies)** which you may need to manually install if your operating system is not up-to-date.

# Getting Started

## I just want to run it
- Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools`)
- Navigate to each tool's directory (i.e. `cd PerformanceCalculator`) and follow the instructions listed in the tool's README.
    - [PerformanceCalculator](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/blob/master/PerformanceCalculator/README.md) - A tool for calculating the difficulty of beatmaps and the performance of replays.
    - [PerformanceCalculatorGUI](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/blob/master/PerformanceCalculatorGUI/README.md) - A GUI tool for calculating the difficulty of beatmaps, changes in profile scores and leaderboards.

## I want to make changes
Most relevant code is in the main [ppy/osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu) repository. To make any meaningful changes you will likely need to edit that as well.

- Clone all relevant repos into the same directory 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu
```
- Run the `./UseLocalOsu.ps1` powershell script (or `./UseLocalOsu.sh`) to use your local copy of ppy/osu

## I want to run someone else's changes

- Clone all relevant repos into the same directory 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu
```
- Navigate to `osu` repository and [checkout](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14383288) version you want to run
```shell
cd osu
git remote add smoogi https://github.com/smoogipoo/osu.git
git fetch smoogi branch_name
git checkout -b branch_name smoogi/branch_name
```
- Run the `./UseLocalOsu.ps1` powershell script (or `./UseLocalOsu.sh`) to use your local copy of ppy/osu
